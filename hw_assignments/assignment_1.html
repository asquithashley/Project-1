      <h3><b>From hand-pulled espresso shots to the sleekest wine bar in town,
        the neighborhood has become a destination to savor.</b></h3>
          <p>New York used to be the city that never sleeps; now it's the city that never
            stops—ever-evolving and always expanding, so much so that the neighborhoods you
            never went to are now the best ones to be in. And while midtown Manhattan may
            still have the edge in museums and hotels, it’s no match for Brooklyn’s buzzy
            shops and Chelsea's fashion-forward cocktail scene. Another neighborhood is
            also getting in on the action: A time-honored hub for music and literature, Harlem
            has, in recent years, seen restaurant openings from chefs like Marcus Samuelsson
             and Joseph "JJ" Johnson, and transformed into a foodie destination for New Yorkers
             and world travelers alike. Here's where to eat if you're in the neighborhood.</p>

          <p>For a taste of soul and spice, head over to The Cecil on 118th Street. This beloved spot delivers a stellar ambiance, ace playlist, and the best curry lime cauliflower on the planet. But for me, one factor trumps them all: the Ginjan Hot Toddy, a cozy winter cocktail offering that is a mix of bourbon, cardamom honey, cinnamon, lemon juice, and hibiscus.</p>

          <p>Looking for the best ramen in the neighborhood? Run—don’t walk—to Jin Ramen. While New York has more excellent ramen shops than even its ravenous residents know what to do with, there are a few purveyors of just-salty-enough broth and slurpy noodles that remind us some joints still stand head and shoyu above the rest. Go, get a bowl of the ramen of your choosing, and bring friends to share sides and starters. Even your plant-loving pals will be satisfied: Jin serves up some of the finest vegetarian ramen in Manhattan.</P>

          <p>Once you’ve had your fill of noodles and crab, why not be bolder, still? Quite possibly the only Somali restaurant in New York City, Safari is very ready to introduce you to some adventurous new foods—just be prepared to get know them. Order the handheld savory pastries, served brimming with ground beef or chicken, and regret nothing. On the side, reach for rice, which is sometimes aggressively spiced but always flavorful. Be ready to sop up the sauces, too, which somehow balance heat and smoke and salt and cream in equal measure. From the white grapefruit juice on the menu and the very atmosphere inside, you’re going to want to drink it all up.</p>

          <p>Of course, every once in a while, even the most adventurous eaters crave comfort. For a taste of home, snag a table at Mountain Bird, which reopened in August 2015 to rave reviews. The (what else?) poultry-focused menu makes the most of its mandate, serving up both classic chicken schnitzel and duck and a so-called “head-to-toe sampler” plate. The chicken heart is a sleeper hit.</p>

          <p>When all else fails, there’s always Italian food. Warming bellies and tantalizing taste buds for centuries, the cuisine has a foothold in Harlem, where it seems modest trattorias materialize every few blocks. Pisticci is one of the best. Kick off dinner with a fresh fennel salad, graduate to antipasti, and be sure to save room for dessert. Your nonna wouldn’t have it any other way. All that food exhausted you? I have just the cure: The Chipped Cup serves up more hand-pulled espresso shots that have been named some of the best in the city.</p>

          <p>After dark, Harlem gets even better. Because while the rest of Manhattan is all wait times and long lines, it’s still possible to get a decent drink for a decent price here. Two of the best destinations for just that are Vinateria and Sexy Taco Dirty Cash. A welcome addition to the neighborhood, Vinateria is a small-plates wine bar—every inch as slick as one you’d find downtown. Despite its evocative name, Sexy Taco Dirty Cash is more than a publicity stunt: The food at this rum-bar-meets-restaurant (wild mushroom tacos; chorizo and goat cheese omelette) is actually good. The Thai Me Up cocktail? Not too shabby, either.</p>

          <p>No matter where you’re going next, be sure to take a bite of Harlem back with you. Hot Bread Kitchen, a start-up located in East Harlem, hires low-income, immigrant, and minority women to both master culinary skills and contribute recipes to an ever-evolving menu of authentic global breads. Pro tip: take home a bunch of crispy Moroccan m’smmen. Eat well. Feel good about it.</p>
